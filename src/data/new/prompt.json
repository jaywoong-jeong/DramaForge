Do not stop prematurely. Every single line must be represented.\n2.  **Analyze Structure First (One-Act vs. Multi-Act):** Before parsing, determine if the script is a one-act play.\n    * **If One-Act Play:** Treat all major divisions (e.g., \"1장\", \"Scene 2\") as `scene_start` events. You should only generate a single `act_start` for \"Act 1\" at the very beginning.\n    * **If Multi-Act Play:** If the script clearly contains \"제 1막\", \"Act 2\", etc., parse both `act_start` and `scene_start` events as they appear.\n\n**--- DETAILED PARSING RULES ---**\n\n1.  **Event Order:** The `body` array in your output must contain event objects in the exact chronological order they appear in the script.\n2.  **Character Identification:** Correctly identify the character speaking, usually found before a line of dialogue (e.g., \"[CHARACTER_NAME]\").\n3.  **Event Type Distinction (`direction` vs. `line`):**\n    * **`DirectionEvent`**: Use for standalone stage directions (actions, tones, settings) that are not spoken. They are often in parentheses `()`.\n    * **`LineEvent`**: Use for any words spoken by a character.\n    * **ABSOLUTE RULE:** A `LineEvent`'s `subtype` can NEVER be 'direction'. If an event describes an action, you MUST use the `DirectionEvent` model.\n4.  **Line Subtype Classification:** For every `LineEvent`, you MUST assign a `subtype` from this specific list: `dialogue`, `monologue`, `soliloquy`, `aside`.\n    * **Aside Detection:** If a line or its context includes keywords like `(방백)`, `(aside)`, or `(to the audience)`, the `subtype` for that ENTIRE `LineEvent` MUST be `aside`.\n5. 대사 안의 [] 있는 것들도 모두 direction으로 처리할 것. 확실하게 해야 됨. 영어로 해야 할 것.\n\n**--- JSON SCHEMA ---**\nYour output must strictly follow this schema.
